Note
======

### Chicago Steno
- 1u sets have been printed in MJF by JLCPCB once with excellent results.
- thumbs are asymmetrical. Each set contains three pairs.
- 1.25~2.25u keys were modified by me and have not tested

### DES, Liminal Chimera
* MX stems are generated with `Tol=0.0`, tested once with good results in SLS. Not sure about resin.

Proceed with caution.
