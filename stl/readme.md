Note
======

* CS sets have been printed in MJF by JLCPCB once with excellent results.
    - CS thumbs are asymmetrical. Each set contains three pairs.
* The first DES resin and MJF test prints failed with stems being too loose. STLs in this
folder have their stem tolerance adjusted to the proper amount, but the printed keycaps
have not arrived yet.

Proceed with caution.
